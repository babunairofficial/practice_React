# üõ†Ô∏è practice_React

Welcome to **practice_React** ‚Äî a fresh start to reinforce and sharpen my understanding of ReactJS through hands-on coding and structured practice.

## üìå About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal ReactJS sandbox, where I revisit core concepts, implement real-world patterns, and reinforce fundamentals.  

Over time, it will evolve into a well-organized collection of my ReactJS exercises, experiments, and deep dives ‚Äî covering everything from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

I plan to build this repository gradually by:
- Revisiting core topics like components, props, and hooks
- Practicing design patterns and architecture in React
- Exploring best practices and performance optimization

This initiative is part of my decision to go back to the basics ‚Äî not because I‚Äôm starting over, but because **mastery lies in refinement**.

Stay tuned ‚Äî this is just the beginning.

##  Step 1: Cleaning Up the Boilerplate

As a first step in this journey, I focused on revisiting the **essential practice of cleaning up the default React boilerplate code** ‚Äî a foundational task that sets the stage for clean, scalable development.

I explored two common ways to initialize a React project:

1. **Using Create React App (CRA)**
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app 01basics

2. **Using Vite (Modern and Lightweight)**
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest

In both cases, I carefully removed unnecessary files, default styles, and placeholder content to get a clean starting point. This helps reduce clutter, confusion, and distractions before diving into real development.

Food for thought : "To learn something, you must unlearn what is no longer useful."

This cleanup ritual is not just technical‚Äîit's philosophical. It represents a mindset of clarity, intentionality, and respect for the codebase. Every great project begins with a clean slate.

##  Step 2: Understanding React Flow & Project Conventions

After cleaning up the default setup, I dedicated time to understanding and aligning with the **right development conventions**, the **React component flow**, and the differences between using `.js` and `.jsx` files ‚Äî especially in **Create React App (CRA)** and **Vite** environments.

###  Focus Areas:

-  **Folder and file structure** best practices
-  **How React "flows"** ‚Äî from entry point to rendering components
-  **`.js` vs `.jsx` usage** in CRA and Vite
-  **Import/export conventions**, extension awareness, and naming clarity

###  React Flow 

Every React project follows a general flow:

1. **Entry Point** ‚Äî `index.js` or `main.jsx`
2. **Root Rendering** ‚Äî ReactDOM renders the root `<App />` component
3. **Component Tree** ‚Äî `<App />` acts as the central controller and renders other components


src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js / main.jsx     # Entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.js / App.jsx        # Root component

While both CRA and VIte support JSX in .js files, using .jsx makes your intent clear ‚Äî especially in component files. Vite, by default, encourages .jsx usage for JSX-heavy files.
