# 🛠️ practice_React

Welcome to **practice_React** — a fresh start to reinforce and sharpen my understanding of ReactJS through hands-on coding and structured practice.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal ReactJS sandbox, where I revisit core concepts, implement real-world patterns, and reinforce fundamentals.  

Over time, it will evolve into a well-organized collection of my ReactJS exercises, experiments, and deep dives — covering everything from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

I plan to build this repository gradually by:
- Revisiting core topics like components, props, and hooks
- Practicing design patterns and architecture in React
- Exploring best practices and performance optimization

This initiative is part of my decision to go back to the basics — not because I’m starting over, but because **mastery lies in refinement**.

Stay tuned — this is just the beginning.
