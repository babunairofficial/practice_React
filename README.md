# üõ†Ô∏è practice_React

Welcome to **practice_React** ‚Äî a fresh start to reinforce and sharpen my understanding of ReactJS through hands-on coding and structured practice.

## üìå About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal ReactJS sandbox, where I revisit core concepts, implement real-world patterns, and reinforce fundamentals.  

Over time, it will evolve into a well-organized collection of my ReactJS exercises, experiments, and deep dives ‚Äî covering everything from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

I plan to build this repository gradually by:
- Revisiting core topics like components, props, and hooks
- Practicing design patterns and architecture in React
- Exploring best practices and performance optimization

This initiative is part of my decision to go back to the basics ‚Äî not because I‚Äôm starting over, but because **mastery lies in refinement**.

Stay tuned ‚Äî this is just the beginning.

##  Step 1: Cleaning Up the Boilerplate

As a first step in this journey, I focused on revisiting the **essential practice of cleaning up the default React boilerplate code** ‚Äî a foundational task that sets the stage for clean, scalable development.

I explored two common ways to initialize a React project:

1. **Using Create React App (CRA)**
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app 01basics

2. **Using Vite (Modern and Lightweight)**
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest

In both cases, I carefully removed unnecessary files, default styles, and placeholder content to get a clean starting point. This helps reduce clutter, confusion, and distractions before diving into real development.

Food for thought : "To learn something, you must unlearn what is no longer useful."

This cleanup ritual is not just technical‚Äîit's philosophical. It represents a mindset of clarity, intentionality, and respect for the codebase. Every great project begins with a clean slate.

##  Step 2: Understanding React Flow & Project Conventions

After cleaning up the default setup, I dedicated time to understanding and aligning with the **right development conventions**, the **React component flow**, and the differences between using `.js` and `.jsx` files ‚Äî especially in **Create React App (CRA)** and **Vite** environments.

###  Focus Areas:

-  **Folder and file structure** best practices
-  **How React "flows"** ‚Äî from entry point to rendering components
-  **`.js` vs `.jsx` usage** in CRA and Vite
-  **Import/export conventions**, extension awareness, and naming clarity

###  React Flow 

Every React project follows a general flow:

1. **Entry Point** ‚Äî `index.js` or `main.jsx`
2. **Root Rendering** ‚Äî ReactDOM renders the root `<App />` component
3. **Component Tree** ‚Äî `<App />` acts as the central controller and renders other components


src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js / main.jsx     # Entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.js / App.jsx        # Root component

While both CRA and VIte support JSX in .js files, using .jsx makes your intent clear ‚Äî especially in component files. Vite, by default, encourages .jsx usage for JSX-heavy files.

##  Step 3: Custom Element Rendering & JSX Internals

As part of my deeper dive into React‚Äôs rendering mechanics, I created minimal custom React apps using different methods to directly control and observe how elements are created and rendered. This step wasn‚Äôt just about outcomes ‚Äî it was about exploring how React *thinks* under the hood.

###  Experiment: Minimal React App ‚Äì Two Versions

####  Version 1: Static JSX ‚Äî Anchor Tag

- Built a component rendering a single `<a>` tag using JSX.
- Focused on JSX syntax fidelity and verifying how React interprets and compiles it into actual DOM structures using `React.createElement`.

####  Version 2: Dynamic Rendering via `for` Loop

- I explicitly used a traditional `for` loop for iterations of elements.
- This was an intentional decision to manually control the rendering process ‚Äî useful when exploring scenarios where iteration logic is complex or conditional.
  
###  Working with `React.createElement`

To get a deeper grip on the abstraction, I manually used `React.createElement()` to create custom elements without JSX. This was a deliberate step to:

- Observe the raw structure React uses to define elements
- Contrast JSX with its underlying function calls
- Appreciate JSX as syntactic clarity rather than necessity

```js
React.createElement(
  'a',
  { href: 'https://example.com', target: '_blank' },
  'Click Here'
);
```

This hands-on exploration reinforced an important point: React‚Äôs strength lies in its declarative abstraction ‚Äî not just in the syntax, but in the architecture it enables.

### Evaluated Expressions in JSX

Reviewed how expressions are injected inside JSX using {} ‚Äî covering simple variables, inline conditionals, and computed results.

Revisited the internal constraints of JSX (e.g., no statements inside JSX, only expressions).

Emphasized clean separation of logic and UI declarations when structuring components.

```jsx
const username = "ReactUser";
return <h2>Welcome, {username}!</h2>;
```
