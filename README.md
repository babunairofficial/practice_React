# üõ†Ô∏è practice_React

Welcome to **practice_React** ‚Äî a fresh start to reinforce and sharpen my understanding of ReactJS through hands-on coding and structured practice.

## üìå About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal ReactJS sandbox, where I revisit core concepts, implement real-world patterns, and reinforce fundamentals.  

Over time, it will evolve into a well-organized collection of my ReactJS exercises, experiments, and deep dives ‚Äî covering everything from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

I plan to build this repository gradually by:
- Revisiting core topics like components, props, and hooks
- Practicing design patterns and architecture in React
- Exploring best practices and performance optimization

This initiative is part of my decision to go back to the basics ‚Äî not because I‚Äôm starting over, but because **mastery lies in refinement**.

Stay tuned ‚Äî this is just the beginning.

##  Step 1: Cleaning Up the Boilerplate

As a first step in this journey, I focused on revisiting the **essential practice of cleaning up the default React boilerplate code** ‚Äî a foundational task that sets the stage for clean, scalable development.

I explored two common ways to initialize a React project:

1. **Using Create React App (CRA)**
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app 01basics

2. **Using Vite (Modern and Lightweight)**
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest

In both cases, I carefully removed unnecessary files, default styles, and placeholder content to get a clean starting point. This helps reduce clutter, confusion, and distractions before diving into real development.

Food for thought : "To learn something, you must unlearn what is no longer useful."

This cleanup ritual is not just technical‚Äîit's philosophical. It represents a mindset of clarity, intentionality, and respect for the codebase. Every great project begins with a clean slate.
